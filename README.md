🚗💡 Driver Drowsiness Detection Using OpenCV & Dlib 💻🧠
Excited to share my latest project – Driver Drowsiness Detection – built using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib! This system monitors a driver’s facial landmarks to detect signs of drowsiness and fatigue, aiming to enhance road safety.

🧑‍💻 Project Overview:
The project uses Dlib’s 68 facial landmark detector to track key facial points—especially around the eyes. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), it determines if the driver is:
✅ Active (eyes open)
⚠ Drowsy (partially closed)
❌ Sleeping (fully closed)

🔍 How It Works:
1️⃣ Capture real-time video using OpenCV.
2️⃣ Detect facial landmarks with Dlib’s pre-trained model.
3️⃣ Calculate the EAR (eye openness) to monitor eye movement.
4️⃣ Identify and alert if the driver is active, drowsy, or sleeping.

🎯 Technologies Used: Python 🐍 | OpenCV 📸 | Dlib 🧠

🚀 Just the Beginning!
This is just the start of my OpenCV journey, and I’m excited to dive deeper into computer vision and AI-powered solutions. I aim to optimize and enhance this project in the future—improving accuracy, efficiency, and real-world applications.

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for future improvements! 💬
